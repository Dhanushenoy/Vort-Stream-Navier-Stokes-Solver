# Vort-Stream-Navier-Stokes-Solver
FDM based vorticity-stream function solver for Navier-stokes equation in Cartesian coordinate. current boundary conditions are for Channel flow

For channel flow-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a matlab function called simpson's rule, written for establishing parabolic inlet boundary.
The outlet boundary has to be changed, so fortemporary, just make the domain longer.
